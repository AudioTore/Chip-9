# Chip-9
Chip 8 inspired Emulator.

Hello, World!

## What's chip 9?

Chip 9 is an emulator directly inspired by the famous Chip 8!
Chip 9 is an instruction set (just like chip 8) interpreter
designed to be even EASIER to implement and get your hands dirty
in emulation. Chip 9 has its own registers, opcodes, etc.

## What too do in Chip 9?

At the moment Chip 9 is a little limited.
My current implementation (which is in this repo's source code) at the moment
can only do so much. However You should read my goals with Chip 9.

## Goals

- [x] Decent specification (will continue to update specification though)
- [ ] Decent instruction Set.
- [ ] Ticktacktoe implemented.
- [ ] Space invaders implemented.
- [ ] My own ROM format (like .ch8)

## Specifications

If you want too implement this yourself the Specifications are in "docs"
